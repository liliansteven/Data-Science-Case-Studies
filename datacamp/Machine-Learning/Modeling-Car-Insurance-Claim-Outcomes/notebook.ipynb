In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n\nKnowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to use simple Logistic Regression, identifying the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy.\n\nThey have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below.","metadata":{},"id":"c3f0e974-faf8-458f-bf2a-06a469d0ea5e","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"\n\n## The dataset\n\n| Column | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `id` | Unique client identifier |\n| `age` | Client's age: <br> <ul><li>`0`: 16-15</li><li>`1`: 26-39</li><li>`2`: 40-64</li><li>`3`: 65+</li></ul> |\n| `gender` | Client's gender: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Female</li><li>`1`: Male</li></ul> |\n| `driving_experience` | Years the client has been driving: <br> <ul><li>`0`: 0-9</li><li>`1`: 10-19</li><li>`2`: 20-29</li><li>`3`: 30+</li></ul> |\n| `education` | Client's level of education: <br> <ul><li>`0`: No education</li><li>`1`: High school</li><li>`2`: University</li></ul> |\n| `income` | Client's income level: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Poverty</li><li>`1`: Working class</li><li>`2`: Middle class</li><li>`3`: Upper class</li></ul> |\n| `credit_score` | Client's credit score (between zero and one) |\n| `vehicle_ownership` | Client's vehicle ownership status: <br><ul><li>`0`: Does not own their vehilce (paying off finance)</li><li>`1`: Owns their vehicle</li></ul> |\n| `vehcile_year` | Year of vehicle registration: <br><ul><li>`0`: Before 2015</li><li>`1`: 2015 or later</li></ul> |\n| `married` | Client's marital status: <br><ul><li>`0`: Not married</li><li>`1`: Married</li></ul> |\n| `children` | Client's number of children |\n| `postal_code` | Client's postal code | \n| `annual_mileage` | Number of miles driven by the client each year |\n| `vehicle_type` | Type of car: <br> <ul><li>`0`: Sedan</li><li>`1`: Sports car</li></ul> |\n| `speeding_violations` | Total number of speeding violations received by the client | \n| `duis` | Number of times the client has been caught driving under the influence of alcohol |\n| `past_accidents` | Total number of previous accidents the client has been involved in |\n| `outcome` | Whether the client made a claim on their car insurance (response variable): <br><ul><li>`0`: No claim</li><li>`1`: Made a claim</li></ul> |","metadata":{},"id":"8928ffdf-25d6-4ad9-909f-0dd8d10b9a42","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import required modules\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import logit","metadata":{"executionTime":733,"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import required modules\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import logit","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1686409332124,"lastScheduledRunId":null},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Read in dataset\ncars = pd.read_csv(\"car_insurance.csv\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":51,"lastExecutedAt":1686409332176,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Read in dataset\ncars = pd.read_csv(\"car_insurance.csv\")"},"cell_type":"code","id":"2deeaffe-0448-4074-8201-210885223b6f","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Fill missing values with the mean\ncars[\"credit_score\"].fillna(cars[\"credit_score\"].mean(), inplace=True)\ncars[\"annual_mileage\"].fillna(cars[\"annual_mileage\"].mean(), inplace=True)","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":47,"lastExecutedAt":1686409332224,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Fill missing values with the mean\ncars[\"credit_score\"].fillna(cars[\"credit_score\"].mean(), inplace=True)\ncars[\"annual_mileage\"].fillna(cars[\"annual_mileage\"].mean(), inplace=True)"},"cell_type":"code","id":"42db71ed-3326-4437-a7b0-37f398b7cf5a","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Empty list to store model results\nmodels = []\n# Feature columns\nfeatures = cars.drop(columns=[\"id\", \"outcome\"]).columns\n# Loop through features\nfor col in features:\n    #
